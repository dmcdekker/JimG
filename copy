                | An exploration of landscapes set to the natural rhythm of nature and time: From the beginnings of a road trip leaving a city to 
                | a desert bed of mountains and sand. A transportation of another kind occurs as mist and the tides offer a distinct view. Back on the rails, 
                | only a shadow knows its destination. Low level clouds help the earth cool. After an orbit has been complete the city from which we've leaped lies 
                | awake waiting for our return.

                | In October, 2003 I got together with several friends to participate in the 48 hour film project. At that time it was a fairly new idea that 
                | pushed filmmakers to write, shoot, and edit a short film within a weekend. The festival supplied you with a list of specific instructions 
                | (as described in the opening sequence) that we, as participants, had to include in our film.
                | We received our instructions on a Friday evening, and about 15 people deliberated for hours late into the night what the film should be. I 
                | ended up writing a script in an hour during the wee hours early that next morning. Then our group shot for about 19 hours Saturday, editing 
                | all day on Sunday and showed the film THAT evening to an enthusiastic packed house in San Francisco.
                | This version here features a different opening scene which was added a few months later to let a completely different packed house audience in 
                | on the know that "this is not any ordinary story".

                | Shot in only a couple of hours and edited in camera on a single roll of super 8 black and white film. 
                | A look at food, wine and the complexity of the moment.
