                | awake waiting for our return.

                | In October, 2003 I got together with several friends to participate in the 48 hour film project. At that time it was a fairly new idea that 
                | pushed filmmakers to write, shoot, and edit a short film within a weekend. The festival supplied you with a list of specific instructions 
                | (as described in the opening sequence) that we, as participants, had to include in our film.
                | We received our instructions on a Friday evening, and about 15 people deliberated for hours late into the night what the film should be. I 
                | ended up writing a script in an hour during the wee hours early that next morning. Then our group shot for about 19 hours Saturday, editing 
                | all day on Sunday and showed the film THAT evening to an enthusiastic packed house in San Francisco.
                | This version here features a different opening scene which was added a few months later to let a completely different packed house audience in 
                | on the know that "this is not any ordinary story".

                | D TOUR (99 mins), is an award winning, powerful, evocative and deeply personal story. Combining a band road trip with a personal 
                | quest for an organ donor, the film follows the journey of Pat Spurgeon, a talented indie rock musician on the rise, whose life becomes
                | consumed with the care and feeding of his failing kidney. Spurgeon, a previous kidney transplant recipient, is part of the organ donor / recipient 
                | community, a special group whose lives become entwined in life and death. On one side are those who are saved through tragedy or by an incredible gift 
                | from a living donor; on the other are the families of the donors, who are offered a chance for hope and bittersweet resolution for their loss. 
                | D TOUR is filled with unexpected twists and the joys and sorrows of life. 
                | Produced, Directed, Photographed, and Edited by Jim Granato
