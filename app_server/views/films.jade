               | An innocent man walks through San Francisco clueless to the fact that the Blue Angels are in town practicing their air show. 
               | After several encounters with the mysterious roars from above and the city's more colorful characters, our hero snaps and runs amok, seeking shelter. 
               | The movies are just around the corner! But, in our hero's case, he's on their corner.

                | A film collaboration (32 min) between six San Francisco filmmakers.  A frenetic fusion of night and day, movement and stasis, 
                | work and play - an iconographic city rides the flux of boom and bust in the 21st century.

                | "So Long, Kodachrome" is an ode to super 8 and the beloved, now defunct, popular color film stock while paying homage to a famous 70â€™s American landmark film.

                | A woman falls asleep on a mountain top, descending into a dream that reconnects her with nature. Shot on Super 8 Kodachrome and Ektachrome 
                | (later hand-processed), "Afternoon Dream" comes from a series of films which take on solitude, landscapes, and the passing of time with more 
                | of an experimental and minimalist approach.

                | An exploration of landscapes set to the natural rhythm of nature and time: From the beginnings of a road trip leaving a city to 
                | a desert bed of mountains and sand. A transportation of another kind occurs as mist and the tides offer a distinct view. Back on the rails, 
                | only a shadow knows its destination. Low level clouds help the earth cool. After an orbit has been complete the city from which we've leaped lies 
                | awake waiting for our return.

                | In October, 2003 I got together with several friends to participate in the 48 hour film project. At that time it was a fairly new idea that 
                | pushed filmmakers to write, shoot, and edit a short film within a weekend. The festival supplied you with a list of specific instructions 
                | (as described in the opening sequence) that we, as participants, had to include in our film.
                | We received our instructions on a Friday evening, and about 15 people deliberated for hours late into the night what the film should be. I 
                | ended up writing a script in an hour during the wee hours early that next morning. Then our group shot for about 19 hours Saturday, editing 
                | all day on Sunday and showed the film THAT evening to an enthusiastic packed house in San Francisco.
                | This version here features a different opening scene which was added a few months later to let a completely different packed house audience in 
                | on the know that "this is not any ordinary story".
