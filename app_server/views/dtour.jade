                | D TOUR (99 mins), directed by Jim Granato, is a powerful, evocative and deeply personal story. Combining a band road trip with a 
                | personal quest for an organ donor, the film follows the journey of Pat Spurgeon, a talented indie rock musician on the rise, whose
                | life becomes consumed with the care and feeding of his failing kidney. Spurgeon, a previous kidney transplant recipient, is part 
                | of the organ donor / recipient community, a special group whose lives become entwined in life and death.

                | On one side are those who 
                | are saved through tragedy or by an incredible gift from a living donor; on the other are the families of the donors, who are offered 
                | a chance for hope and bittersweet resolution for their loss. D TOUR is filled with unexpected twists and the joys and sorrows of life. 
                | Pat Spurgeon is an integral part of the indie pop band Rogue Wave, whose four critically acclaimed albums and performances worldwide have 
                | earned them a growing fan base. As the film begins, Spurgeon is embarking on tour, an exhausting prospect even for healthy musicians, but 
                | almost impossible for someone coping with dialysis, dietary restrictions and the search for a living donor match.

                | While his choice to keep 
                | touring and working towards the band's goals is put to the test, Spurgeon continues to deal with his challenges in a straightforward and 
                | matter-of-fact way. D TOUR addresses issues within the U.S. healthcare system, including the lack of affordable insurance, the importance of 
                | organ donation, and much more.
